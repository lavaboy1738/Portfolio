## 🚨 Before you fork (please read!!!)

A few people have contacted me asking if they can use my code for learning or for their own website, and the answer is **yes, absolutely, but please credit me dawg**. 

I wanted to share this project with all of y'all and that's why I pushed the code up here. However, keep in mind that, _**plagiarism is bad**_. So please give credits for the creators, as I did so with many websites from where I drew my inspirations. I spent quite a lot of time and effort building and designing this project, the least you can do is to give me credit, as well as all the sites I credited. 

### TL;DR

Yes, feel free to fork this repo. Please give me proper credit by linking back to [ronniefeng.com](https://ronniefeng.com). Thanks!
